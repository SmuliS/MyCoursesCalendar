# MyCoursesCalendar
This application improves the ics file given by MyCourses by making the event name more descriptive (e.g. "T-61.3050 L1, T1 (Machine Learning: Basic Principles)"). The output file can be imported to Google Calendar for example.

## Installation
Before using this script you should install BeautifulSoup (pip install beautifulsoup4) and iCalendar (https://github.com/collective/icalendar/blob/master/docs/install.rst) python packages, and clone this repository to your local machine.

## Usage
Edit the calendar url to point to your personal calendar that you can find from the MyCourses web page. When you run this script, an improved version of that ics file will be generated in the same folder with the script.
